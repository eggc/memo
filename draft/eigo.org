* 基本

- 形容詞は名詞を修飾する
- 副詞は名詞以外を修飾する

- 動名詞は動詞を変形させて名詞として働かせる
- 分詞構文は動詞を変形させて副詞として働かせる

- 感情系の動詞は日本語と考え方が全く逆
- 物が主語になり目的語に人をとる
- 人を主語にとる時は受動態になる

* 音の話
** be 動詞は聞こえない

* 単語・熟語

| 英語                         | 日本語                                                     |
|------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------|

| attribute 結果 to 原因       | 原因があって結果になった（attribute 自体の意味はほぼない） |

* 不可算名詞

1. 切り分けても使えるもの
   water, coffee, bread, cake, chalk, land
2. 見えないもの
   work, news, advice, information, research, translation, traffic, humor, music, time
3. ひとまとめ
   buggage, luggage, furniture, equipment, fluit, food

不可算名詞であえて量と表現したいときは下記のような表現を使う

- some advice
- much time
- a cup of coffee
- two cups of coffee
- a piece of cake
- two pieces of cake

不可算名詞は単数扱いなので、動詞を伴うときは三単現のsがつくことがある

The increased traffic causes a lot of delays around the city.

time は可算名詞になることもある。

- Do you remember the time when we went to an amusement park?
- I’ve been to London three times.

* 前置詞

by A 近くを表すが「差」を表すこともある

under A は A に覆われていて、支配を受けているイメージ。

| under construction               | 工事中         |
| under way.                       | 進行中         |
| under repair.                    | 修理中         |
| under stress.                    | ストレスの下で |
| undert the influence (of alchol) | （酒に）酔って |

despite A は A にも関わらず。

* 副詞

I live (here) は here を省略できる。こういった文法的に余分な単語を副詞という。
副詞は名詞以外を修飾する。

他動詞 ... 「何を？」を聴きたくなる動詞
自動詞 ... それ以外の動詞

しかし単純に分けられない。たとえば grow は他動詞/自動詞どちらにも使う。

名詞に ly がつくと形容詞になる: friend -> friendly
形容詞に ly がつくと副詞になる: happy -> happily

* 細かいこと

- 数を表す形容詞
  - all は後ろに複数形がくる。
  - each, every, either (3つのe)とは後ろに単数形がくる。これらは可算名詞と使う。
- 冠詞は日本語では区別がつかないので下のように考えるとよい
  - the ... 共通で認識できるもの
  - a ... たくさんあるもののどれか

  - others ... それ以外で、たくさんあるもの複数（代名詞として使う）

- 繰り返しを避けるとき

  - one ... 同じ種類の違うものを指す
    - He was tired of his job and decided to apply for ~one~ at another company.
    - ここでは his job に応募したのではなくて、別の job に応募しているので one を使っている
- 代動詞 ... 前に出てきた動詞を置き換える do のこと
- 比較するときは同じもので比較する
  - The subway system of London is older than that of New York.
  - The climate of Tokyo is milder than that of Hokkaido.
  - 省略はできない → the climate of Tokyo is milder than Hokkaido.
  - The office has more plants than it did last year.
- 代名詞になることのできる形容詞
  - many(可算), most(不可算), all, none, both などは代名詞になれる
  - almost, every, no は代名詞になれない

文型からなんとなく意味を察することができたるするので大事よ。
go to school は不可算名詞だから冠詞つかない。go to bed とかもそう。
それらはもとの意味は名詞なんだけど動詞的に扱われているらしい。
勉強とか、眠るとかっていう意味合いで使うから不可算名詞になるとのこと。
ちなみに学校の建物をイメージしているなら go to the school ということは普通にあるらしい。
遠足とか何かしら行事とかあってるかもしれない場合は go to school になる。

** 第11講 時制

現在形は習慣（いつもやること）
進行形は動作の途中

- Ken plays soccer when he has time. # 接続詞は弱く読まれる！
- Ken plays soccer every day. # every day. は発音は everyday と一緒。だけど everyday にすると形容詞になってしまうので書く時は every day と書く。
- Ken plays soccer every Sunday.
- Ken is playing soccer right now. # right now = 今 は本当によく使う表現
- Ken is waring glasses. # メガネをかけてる状態
- Ken is putting on glasses. # メガネをまさにかけようとしている途中
- Ken is riding the bus. # バスに乗っている状態
- Ken is getting on the bus. # バスに乗り込んでいる途中
- Ken is getting on the ship.
- Ken is getting on the train.
- Ken is getting in the car.  # 車の時だけ in になるよ

** 第12講 状態動詞と動作動詞

進行形にできない動詞がある。それが状態動詞。
はじめや終わりがはっきりしない動詞と考えるとよいらしい。

始点? --------> 終点?

| have, own, belong,     | 所有・所属の終わりはわからない           |
| love, hate             | いつ好きになるか、嫌いになるかわからない |
| know, remember, forget | しっているとか覚えるとかもわからない  |

Ken is enjoying the story.
I have a car.
I own a car.
I belong to the tennis club.
I love Ken.
I hate John.
I know John.
I remember John.
I forget John's face.
John is always forgetting. # いっつも忘れてる

絶妙に進行形にできるという例外がたくさんある。

I'm loving it. # 超好きみたいなニュアンス？ 基本的に言えない。
I'm having fun.
I'm having lunch.
I'm looking at you.
You look good.
You're looking good. # 普段と違う格好をしていて良いねというニュアンス
Ken is smelling the flowsers.
The flowers semll good.
Ken is tasting the wine.
This wine tastes great.

The tower stands at the top of the hill. # 建築物は「立つ」動作をしないから進行形にならない
Ken is standing over there.

** 第13講 進行形

時の一点と進行形は相性がいい。

--- 本を読む --|-- 本を読み終わる --->
               ^
               電話が鳴る

- Ken was reading a book when his phone rang.
- Ken was taking a bath when John came.
- Ken will be traveling to Nara at this time tomorrow. # 未来の時点を表している（がこの表現は普通使わない）
- Ken will be attending the meeting tomorrow. # 単に予定を表している
- The library will be closing in ten minutes. # 10分で閉まるという予定を表している
- Ken is attending the meeting tomorrow. # これも予定（もっとも使われやすい）
- Ken is going to attend the meeting tomorrow. # これも予定
- Ken is gonna attend the meeting tomorrow. # これでもいい
- Ken is attending the meeting right now. # これは予定ではない


attend は意識を伸ばすという語義
xxxant は人

- attend the meeting
  - attendance # 出席、出席者数
  - an attendee # 出席者
- attend to a person # お世話をする ...
  - an flight attendant # 添乗員
  - attention # 注目

** 第14講 完了形

完了形は、今について説明するものなので、具体的な時間表現と併用できない
have は助動詞

- I've finished my homework.
- I've alreday finished my homework.
- I've just finished my homework.
- I finisihed my homework yesterday.
- I finisihed my homework 1 minute ago.
- I finisihed my homework last week.
- I have a lot of homework.
- I've already bought a pen.
- I've already eaten dinner.
- Have you finished your homework yet?
- Have you eaten dinner yet?
- Did you eat yet?
- I haven't finished my homework yet.
- I haven't eaten my dinner yet.
-

work は「仕事」というとき、不可算名詞になる。 homework も同じ。
work は「作品」というとき、加算名詞になる。
work assignment で加算名詞になる。

** 第15講 完了形2 経験用法

すごいよく使う表現。現在に焦点があたってる。
once, twice, times, ever, never がよく出てくる

- I have been to Nara twice.
- Have you ever been to nara?
- I have never been to nara.
- I haven't been to nara.

** 第16講 完了形3 継続用法

- since は起点
- for は期間

- I've known John ~since 2010~.
- I've been in Tokyo ~since 2010~. # 発音が難しい アイヴビニン tokyo
- I've known John ~for five years~. # 5年という期間
- How long have you been in Tokyo?

** 第19講

last year と yesterday は副詞なので前置詞いらない。
受動態は誰がやったかわからない時や、誰がやったか自明のときに使われる。
受動態では、目的語が消える（もしくは副詞節になる）

語末のeは発音しない。サイレントe。cake
母音の音が長い音に変わる（二重母音）という不思議なことが起こる。
at → ate
mad → made
bit → bite
cut → cute
pet → Pete (ピート：人の名前)
hop → hope
can → cane (ケイン：杖)

** 第21講 受動態

自動詞は受動態にできないので was risen はありえない。

- Ken was born and raised in San Diego.
- The sun rises in the east. # いつも変わらないことなので現在形
- The sun rose two hours ago.
- The sun has already risen.
- Raise your hand.
- Ken raised his hand.
- Ken is raising two kids.
- We raised a lot of money.
** 第22講 受動態

自動詞 speak は単体で受動態にできないので to が必要！
すべての自動詞がそう言う振る舞いをするわけではないので例外として覚えとこう

- A stranger spoke to Ken.
- Ken was spoken to by a stranger.
- Everyone looks up to Ken # everyone は単数扱い
- Ken is looked up to by everyone.

- laugh at
- look at
- look up to = respect
- look down on
- look after
- take care of

- John was laughed at by everyone.
- Everyone laughed at John.
- John was looked at by everyone.
- Everyone looked at John.
- John was looked down on by everyone.
- Everyone looked down on John.
- I was looked after by my grandmother.
- my grandmother looked after me.
- i was taken care of by my grandmother.
- my grandmother took care of me.

** 第23講 不定詞

Johns dream is a dream. は SVC の文章だが S = C が微妙に成り立ってないのでおかしい。
Johns dream is to be a doctor. は S = C が成り立つので正しい。 to be a doctor は名詞句。
Johns dream is to be a lawer.
John wants to be a doctor. これは SVO の O が名詞句になってる。
John wants to go to Canada. 同じ。
To eat breakfast is good. は、文法上は正しいことになっているが、自然だとは感じられない。
it is good to eat breakfast. なら正しい。
it is good to exrcise.
it is good for you to eat breakfast は you が意味上の主語

** 第24講 不定詞

名詞用法の意味上の主語に for を使うのか of を使うのかという問題
it is を you are に置き換えた時に S V C が成り立つ時には of を使う


- it is very kind of you to help me.
- it is very kind of you to say that.
- it is very sweet of you to come here.
- it is very kind of you.
- thank you for helping me.
- You are very kind to come here.
- its nice of you to come here. = you are nice to come here.
- its stupid of you to come here. = you are stupid to come here.
- its wise of you to enter the tokyo university.
- its clever of you to come here.
- its rude of you to say such a thing.
- its careless of you to say such a thing.

まとめ

- it's careless of you to say such a thing = 君がそんなこと言うなんてうかつだな
- it's important for you to study English  = 君が英語を勉強するのは大事です

it is ... of/for ... の使い分けがいる。これは下記のようにして判断できる。

- you are careless to say such a thing と言い換えできる you = careless なので of
- you are important to study English と言い換えられない you = important ではないので for

文法問題を解く時はこうするけど日常では文法考えずにパターンで覚えるのでいい

** 第25講 不定詞(形容詞・副詞的な用法)

動詞っぽいけど別の品詞としてはたらくものを準動詞という。
形容詞の用法例。to xxx は二語以上なので形容詞だけど後ろから修飾している。

- Ken does not have anything to buy. = 買うものが何にもない(not ... any で全否定)
- I have so many things to do. = たくさんやることがある
- I have time to see John. = ジョンに会う時間はある
- I dont have time to go home.  = 帰る時間がない

副詞

- Ken went to London to see John.
- To see John, Ken went to London. # カンマおかなくてもOK、むしろ置かない派の人もいる。
- Ken went to London in order to see John. # 「〜のために」という意味は変わらないけど固い表現になる。
- Ken went to London so as to see John. # 上と同じだけどさらに固い表現

不定詞の目的語が消えてなくなって前にかかっていることが多い。でも目的語あることも当然ある。
- order
  - 整理整頓
    - 順調
      - 準備しておく
    - 順序 alphabetical order
    - 序列
      - 秩序
        - 制度
      - 上下関係
        - 命令
        - 注文

** 第26講 不定詞(副詞的な用法)

過去分詞が準動詞になっている時は目的語を取れないので注意。
不定詞なら目的語をとれる。
以下は不定詞で、感情の原因を説明する。

Susan was happy to meet Ken.
I'm happy to meet you.
I'm glad to meet you.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I was surprised to see Ken.
I was excited to see Ken.

結果の不定詞もある。

John arrived at the store only to find it closed. # only to ... は 😢 なときにしか使わない

発音
- see はスィ
- she はシュ
- She sits and sees the sea. は最初の she だけシュで他はスーでいい

** 第27講 不定詞 too ... to

too が入ることで否定的な意味になる。
主語にいるから to 不定詞の目的語は消えてなくなる。
接続詞を使う場合は buy の目的語を省略できない。
主語にいない to 不定詞の目的語はしっかり残る。

the house is so expensive that we cannot buy it.
John is too young to drive a car.
The house is too expensive to buy.

pens ... 吊るす
depend ... 下に吊るす→依存している
pendulum ... 振り子
expensive ... 秤に測って外に出す -> 高価な
expenditure ... お金を出す
expend -> spend ... 費やす
expsense ... 費用

** 第28講 不定詞 enough

John is tall enough to ride the ride.
Ken ran fast enough to catch the thief.
John was clever enough to ask that important question. # よく使う表現
John was so clever as to ask that important question. # 上と同じ意味だけど固い so that より固い

** 第29講 不定詞 tough 構文

副詞的な用法。目的語がいないやつ。

- John is difficult to please.
- John is hard to talk to.
- John is tough to talk to.
- Ken is easy to please.

easy の例文

- You can go to the hotel more easily on foot.

** 第30講 不定詞と動名詞 decide/stop/avoid/...

結局覚えるしかないんや…

不定詞を後ろにとる動詞は want, hope, decide, promise, plan
これからやること（まだしてないこと）

Ken has decided to quit playing soccer.
I want to get into Waseda.
I hope to get into Waseda.
I've promised to get a job.
I've decided to get a job.
I'm planning to get a job.

動名詞をとる動詞は quit give up finish stop
してしまったこと（すでにしていること）

I quit playing soccer # quit は過去形も quit なので注意
I gave up playing soccer
I've finished eating lunch
I stopped complaining

やめる動詞・延期する動詞 postpone / put off / delay も動名詞を使う

We postponed holding the meeting.
We pull off holding the meeting.
We delayed holding the meeting.

Ken considered going to the doctor. # 考慮する(思い浮かべている)
Ken missed going to the doctor.
Ken avoided going to the doctor.

塊の中では動詞だけど全体では名詞として働く
主語の場合は場所が変わる。

Playing the piano is fun.
Its fun to play the piano.

補語の場合はほとんど同じ。

My hobby is playing the piano. # 現在進行形ではない SVC なので注意
My hobby is to play the piano

動名詞は前置詞とくっつくことができる。しかし不定詞はくっつかない。

By working part-time, Ken earned a lot of money.

Would you mind me opening the window? # 意味上の主語 me が出てきて私が窓を開けてもいいですか？
Would you mind my opening the window? # 厳格な文法上は my だけど、一般には me で言われる
Would you mind if I open the window?

意味上の主語が書かれてない場合は、主文の主語が使われる。

Would you mind opening the window? # 窓を開けてもらえません？
Would you mind me using your phone. # 電話使ってもいいですか？（貸してもらえませんか？）

mind は「気にさわる」なので

Yes. だと「😵 開けないで」という意味になる。
No. だと「😊 開けていいよ」という意味になる。

実際断るときは
😵 actually, its a bit cold.
😊 No, go ahead  # どうぞ
😊 No, not at all # 気にしないよ

** 第32講 不定詞と動名詞 used to do / be used to doing

to は未来志向なので注意しよう

- Don't forget to visit John tomorrow  # 明日 John に訪ねるのを忘れないようにしてね
- Remember to visit John tomorrow
- I forgot to visit John # John に会いに行くことをわすれてた
- I forgot visiting John # John に会ったことをわすれた
- I remembered to visit John
- I remembered visiting John

ややこしい

- Ken is used to living in Japan # 日本に住むのに慣れている
- Ken used to live in Japan # かつて日本に住んでいた

to を前置詞として伴う動詞たち。

| 例文                      | 意味                               |
|---------------------------+------------------------------------|
| I'm used to it            | 慣れる                             |
| I've got used to it       | 慣れた                             |
| I'm accustomed to it      | 慣れる                             |
| I've got accustomed to it | 慣れた                             |
| I'm looking forward to it | 楽しみにしてる                     |
| I objected to it          | 反対してる                         |
| What do you say to that.  | それ何て思う？（カジュアルな表現） |

この例文の中の it は全部 living in Japan みたいな動名詞に置き換えられる

I am used to it の文法的解釈は 主語 + be動詞 + 形容詞 used + 前置詞 to + 名詞 it

I used to 動詞 は不定詞というよりも 主語 + 助動詞 + 動詞原型 という感じ。
なので意味は昔はよく xxxx していた。みたいな表現になる。

** 第33講 分詞

動詞が、形容詞的に働く。
分詞は英語で participle という。
動詞の役割も持つけど形容詞の働きも分け与えられてるというニュアンス。

- John welcomed the arriving guests.

形容詞が就職するとき、そこには主述の関係が成り立つ。
pretty girls => girls are pritty

an arriving guest => guest is arriving # 能動的な関係
a broken window => a window was broken # 受動的な関係

節が長くなると後ろから前に修飾する。

John welcomed the guests arriving at the wedding.
Ken fixed the window broken by John.
I saw some sliming people
There were many people smiling at the baby.
Jane sent a written message.
Jane got a message written by Ken.

- message の mes は送る
- mission は、送られること（使命）
- missionary は、使節団
- emission 外に送る = 排出ガスの排出
  - emit 発する
  - admit おくられたものを認める
  - permit おくられたものを許可する

** 第34講 分詞 surprise/interest/tire/annoy

下記の文 surprised は形容詞として働く surprise の過去分詞。

Ken was surprised at the results.

The results surprised Ken.
Ken was surprised at the results.

感情「驚く」は一人ではできないから、驚かせる原因がある。
なので surprise は「驚かせる」という動詞になっている。

The results were surprising.
The baseball game was very exciting.
The game excited Ken.
Ken was excited by the game.

その他の感情動詞
surprise, amaze, interest, excite, tire, exhaust, annoy, irritate, thrill

thrill はゾクゾク、ワクワクするというプラスの意味
scare は怖いというマイナスの意味

I was interested in the TV show.
The TV show was interesting.
I was tired from the meeting. # つかれちゃった
I was tired of the meeting. # うんざり
the meeting was tiring.
I was annoyed by the weather. # いらいらさせられる
The weather was annoying

感情の動詞は日本語の感覚からすると自動詞なんだけど、
英語では他動詞になっている。

主語 = 感情の原因
目的語 = 人

例:

The dog surprised me. # 犬にびっくりした
I surprised the dog. # 私が犬をびっくりさせた

John was annoyed  # ジョンはイライラしている
John was annoying # ジョンはイライラさせる原因になっている（ジョンはうざい）
Ken was amazed  # けんは驚いた
Ken was amazing # けんはすごい

** 第35講 分詞構文

Entering the room, I saw John.

副詞節 = Entering the room
主節 = I saw John

副詞節の中では Entering が動詞、 the room が目的語になっている。
もし Entered みたいに過去分詞にすると the room を取らなくなる。
固い表現で小説のようになり口語では利用しない。
意味上の主語は、主節の主語と一致しているので注意。

意味は「時」だったり「理由」だったりもするのであまり訳を考えず読んでいい。

Seeing John, I became happy.

Seen from the sky, the island looks like a dog.

意味上の主語を一致させるためには Seeing は使えない。
また、目的語がないので To see も使えない。
よって過去分詞 Seen になる。

# ニュージーランドはラグビーが人気
Born in New Zealand, Ken is a great rubgy player.

being xxx の分詞構文は being を省略して、形容詞だけポンとおいてあるケースもある。

Unable to speak English, John was at a loss.

- isle # 小島。発音はアイル
- island # 島
- isolate # 切り離す。隔離。
- insulate # 絶縁する。防音・防熱する。
- insulation # 絶縁体。防音・防熱の仕切り。

** 第36講 分詞構文 否定系・過去完了の分詞構文

準動詞は接続詞なしで置くことができる。
意味上の主語が一致していることに注意してみよう。
否定語の not は ing の前に置かないといけない。
Not knowing what to do, Ken went home # home は副詞だよ
→ （どこかに行ってみたが）何をするのかわからなくて、けんは家に帰った

Not looking carefully, Ken got hit by a car.
→ 注意してなくて、けんは車にぶつかった

分詞構文は、現在完了型をとることもできる。
とりあえず、主節より前の時間を取りたい時に完了型にするということにしていい。
Having finished his work, Ken went home
→ 仕事が終わって、けんは家に帰った

Having eaten too much, Ken got a stomachache.
→ 食べすぎたから、けんはお腹が痛くなった

ache は可算名詞なことが多い
pain は不可算名詞なことが多い

stomachache はアメリカでは可算名詞になるが、イギリス英語では不可算名詞。
headache はどちらも可算名詞になる。
toothache 2本以上の歯痛でも同じ。

まとめると ache は可算名詞だということでOK。

** 第37講 分詞構文 過去完了の否定系の分詞構文

~Not having finished~ his work, Ken stayed at his office.

I havent finished my homework みたいなのが普通だけど
分詞構文では not having になるのだ。否定語は分詞構文の直前におく。

~Not having brought~ his wallet, Ken couldn't buy a drink.

| 日本 | アメリカ | イギリス        |
|------+----------+-----------------|
| 紙幣 | bill     | note(bank note) |
| 会計 | check    | bill            |

wallet → 財布
purse → 手提げ鞄・古銭入れ

ドルは頭につく $10
セントは後ろにつく 10¢

| 呼び方  | 金額 |
|---------+------|
| penny   | 1¢   |
| nickel  | 5¢   |
| dime    | 10¢  |
| quarter | 25¢  |
| buck    | $1   |

** 第38講 独立分詞構文

主節の主語と、従属節の主語が一致しない特例がある。

# 天候から判断すると、試合は中止されるだろう
Judging from the weather, the game might be canceled.
Judging by the weather, the game might be canceled.

こういうのを「独立分詞構文」という。
話し手が従属節の主語になる。他の例も見ていこう。

# はっきり言って、仕事やめた方がいいぞ
Flankly speaking, you should quit your job.
Speaking of john, I heard he got married last month.
Considering the weather, the game might be canceled.

これはもう considering という前置詞だと考えるほうが筋が通りやすい。
明治的に従属節の主語が書いてあるケースの独立分詞構文もある。

Weather permitting, the game will be held.

付帯状況の with というのがある。

# けんは腕を組んだまま座っていた
Ken was sitting with his arms crossed.
Ken was sitting with his arms folded.
Ken was sitting with his legs crossed.
Ken was sitting with his eyes closed.

これもある種の独立分詞構文と考えることもできる。
his arm が従属節の主語で、crossed が述語。

frank はネガティブな意味で言う。
# はっきり言って、ジョンは嫌い ☹️
Flankly speaking, I don't like John.
To be frank with you, I dont like John.

** 第39講 使役動詞 make/have/let

make は SVOC の形を取ることができる。
そして C には動詞原型が入ることもある。
このときの O は主語で C は述語として振る舞う。

# けんは（やや強引に）息子を家に止まらせた
Ken made his son stay home.

# けんは息子に警察へ電話させた
Ken had his son call the police.

# けんは息子に海外留学をさせてあげた
Ken let his son study abroad in Japan.

# police はこれ自体が複数の意味を持つ不可算名詞なのだ…。
# 一人の警察官には police は使えない。
There are many police here.
There are many police officers here.
There is a police officer here.


road [ou]
broad [a:]
abroad [a:]
broaden [a:]
broadcast [a:]

** 第40講 SVO to do

使役動詞では SVO + 動詞原型だった。
しかし SVO + to 不定詞をとる動詞もある。

# けんは、息子にけんを手伝わせた
Ken got his son to help him.

# 来て欲しかった
I wanted Ken to come.

# 来なさいと話した
I told Ken to come.

# 来てよと頼んだ
I asked Ken to come.

# 強引に来させた
I got Ken to come.

# 力でさせる
I forced Ken to come.

# 求める
I required Ken to come.

# お願いする
I requested Ken to come.

# 忠告する（動詞の advise は語尾が「アドバイズ」で濁るので注意）
I advised Ken to come.

# 勇気を与える
I encouraged Ken to come.

His parents permitted Ken to study abroad

# allow は「アラウ」と読む
His parents allowed Ken to study abroad.

His salary enabled Ken to buy a car.
His salary allowed Ken to buy a car.

# 勇気を引き剥がす
Ken discouraged John from quitting his job.

The weather prevented the boys from playing soccer.

The teacher stopped the students from talking.

The rule kept the kids from going out after 8 p.m.

the law bans people from entering the country.

# 禁止 litter はゴミを捨てること
the law prohibit people from littering.

# おそれ、抑止
the law deterred people from driving too fast.

** 第41講 受け身の have

使役動詞の動詞部分には原型じゃなくて過去分詞（受動態）を置くこともできる。

# Jane は車を修理してもらった
Jane had her car fixed.
Jane got her car fixed.

Jane had John fix her car.
Jane get John to fix her car.
Jane made John fix her car.

しかし同じ文型なのに解釈が違うこともあるので注意。

# John は車を盗まれてしまった（被害をうけとるhave）
John had his car stolen.

# need は to ... 受動態の他に動名詞を目的語にとれる
# need ... ing は意味上の目的語が主語と一致する
The machine needs to be fixed.
The machine need fixing.
London is worth visiting.

** 第42講 SVOC の make

目的語だけど主語と同じにしたいときは再帰代名詞を使う。
そして make の特殊な事例。

# Ken は自分の言っていることを英語で理解してもらった
Ken made himself understood in English.
--- ---- ------- ---------------------
 S   V     O(主)  →     C(述)

OC の部分をわかりやすくすると

受動態になっているから真の主語は誰だかわからない。
??? is understanding Ken's words in English.

# Ken は自分の言っていることを試合で聞いてもらった
Ken made himself heard at the game.

???? is hearing Ken's words at the game.

** 第43講 知覚動詞

使役動詞ではないのに目的語＋動詞原型を取ることがある。
それが知覚動詞。

# Ken は Jane が通りを渡っているところを見た
Ken saw Jane cross the street.
--- --- ---- ----------------
 S   V    O     C

動詞の原型だけじゃなくて現在分詞もとることができる。

# Ken は Jane が通りを渡っているところを見た
Ken saw Jane crossing the street.

意味的な違いはほぼないから和訳する時は使い分ける必要なし。

Ken heard Jane sing.
Ken heard Jane singing.

実は過去分詞もおくことができる。これは受動態のように訳すれば良い。

# Ken は（誰かに）名前が呼ばれるのを聞いた
Ken heard his name called

発音
sing は鋭いス
thing は柔らかいス

** 第44講 使役動詞、知覚動詞の受動態（マニアックな知識）

# ken は家を離れるのが見られた
Ken was seen to leave the house.
--- -------- ------------------
 S     V             C

これは受動態なので元に戻すと下記になる。
知覚動詞 + 動詞原型のスタイル。

They saw Ken leave the house.

受動態のときはなぜか to leave になっている。
これは特別なルールで本当に紛らわしい。

They saw Ken leaving the house.

なら下記のように to はつかなくなる。

Ken was seen leaving the house.

これはもうそういう物だと割り切るしかない…。

Ken was heard to complain.
Ken was heard complaining.
Ken was made to clean his room.

不定詞の副詞用法ではないことに注意

Let the reason be known to the group.

Let は原型しかおけないので、受け身系にするには be をつけないといけない。

Let it be
Let it go

とかを思い出そう。

** 第45講 関係代名詞

Ken interviewed people who were interested in the job.
--- ----------- ------ -------------------------------
 S       V         O       これは形容詞として働く

O が先行詞になっている。上の例文では who が主語なので主格。
関係代名詞を置くと、新たに動詞をおける。

The mountain which I cilmbed last year was Mt. Fuji.
------------ ------------------------- --- ---------
    S             形容詞として働く      V      C

形容詞節には climbed 目的語がなくなっている。
しかし which が目的語として働いている。これを目的格という。
目的格は省略することができる。

The mountain I cilmbed last year was Mt. Fuji.

Ken saw a girl whose name was Susan.
--- --- ------ --------------------
S    V    O          形容詞

形容詞節は主語、動詞、目的語を持っている。
実は冠詞が足りていない。whose がその代わりに働いている。こういうのを所有格という。

** 第46講 関係代名詞2

先行詞が人じゃなくても whose は使える。

John is from a country whose officieal language is Spanish.

先行詞と関係代名詞は離れていることもある。こういうのを要素の分離という。

There are many students in my class who want to study Spanish.
----- --- -------------             --- -------------
       V    S                        S    V

そして、先行詞の後の動詞は students の複数形にかかっているので動詞原型になってる。
こういうのは主述の一致という。関係代名詞の中でもそういうのがあるという注意。

目的格の whom は滅多に使わない。who でもいいし、省略してもいい。

There are many students in my class whom I do not know.
There are many students in my class who I do not know.
There are many students in my class I do not know.

** 第47講 関係代名詞3 what

What I like about Ken is his voice.
---- - ---- --------- -- ---------
 O'  S' V'             V    C

like の目的語がなくなっているのは what が補っているから。
普通の関係代名詞がつくる句は形容詞句だった。
しかし What がつくる句は名詞句なのだ。
What は先行詞を持たない。

# ジョンは前の彼と違う
John is different from what he was.
---- -- --------- ---- -----------
            C           C'  S'  V'

上の例も、what が名詞句を作っている。補語になっている。

I don't know what Ken likes.
             --------------
                   O'

The world isn't what it was.
                -----------
                   C'

こんな感じで what はいろんな使い道がある。
一貫しているのは、名詞句を作るというところ。

** 第48講 関係代名詞4 where

Japan was the country which I visited two years ago.
----- --- ----------- -----------------------------
                        O'  S'  V'

塊は形容詞として働く。

Japan was the country where I went two years ago.
                      --------------------------
                            S' V'

この塊は副詞として働く。なぜなら、went は自動詞で目的語を取らない。
上の例文は言い換えることができる。

Japan was the country which I went to two years ago.
                      -----------------------------
                        O'  S' V'

関係副詞の従属節は完全な文になっている。

Japan is the country where I live.
Japan is the country which I live in.
Japan is the country in which I live.

I live in Japan      # 長く住んでるイメージ
I'm living in Japan  # 短期間住んでるイメージ

** 第49講 関係代名詞5

関係副詞の例は下記の通り。

# 地球温暖化が解決されるときがくるかもしれない
The time might come when global warnming can be solved.
-------- ----------      --------------- -------------
  S          V                 S'            V'

従属節に欠けている主語・目的語がないことに注目。
先行詞は time。先行詞と従属節が離れているのは、
修飾する文章を後ろに持ってくるという性質があるため。

I do not know the reason why John was late for school.
- ----------- ----------     ---- --- ---------------
S    V             O          S'   V'    C'

reason や why のどちらか一方は省略してもいい。

I do not know why John was late for school.
I do not know the reson John was late for school.

reason が先行詞だからといって常に関係副詞を使うとは限らない。

# ジョンが私に与えた理由は、疑わしいものだった
The reason which John gave me was suspicious
---------- ----- ---- ---- -- --- ----------
    S       O2'    S'   V' O1' V    C

# ケンは来るんじゃね
I suspect Ken will come.
I guess Ken will come.
I bilieve Ken will come.

# ケンは来ねぇだろう
I doubt Ken will come.
I don't bilieve Ken will come.

# ウォーで読む単語
- war
- warm
- reward

** 第50講 関係代名詞6

I do not know how John finished the task
- ----------- --- ---- -------- --------
S       V      O   S'     V'      O'

上の文では、従属文は主語・述語・目的語全て備わっているので how が使える。
他の疑問代名詞を使う場合は主語・述語・目的語のどれかを欠いている（疑問詞がそこに入る）。

I do not know who finished the task
              --- -------- --------
               S'    V'       O'

I do not know which I choose.
              ----- - ------
               O'   S'  V'

I do not know what Ken ate.
              ---- --- ---
               O'   S'  V'

疑問副詞のパターン

I do not know where Ken went.
              ----  --- ----
               O'    S'  V'

I do not know when Ken finished the task.
                   --- -------- --------

how は先行詞を持たない。そして従属節では副詞、全体では名詞として働く。
what も同じく先行詞を持たない。そして従属節では名詞、全体でも名詞として働く。

How John finished the task was unknown.

# 俺たちはやり方はこれ
This is how we do it.

# 俺たちのやってることはこれ
This is what we do

I dont know the way John finished the task.
The way John finished the task was unknown.
this is the way we do it.

the way S V
# 下記は同格の that と呼ばれる、これは頻繁に省略される
the way that S V
# 下記は関係代名詞を使っている
This is the way in which John finished the task.

** 第51講 関係代名詞7

Ken saw Susan, who graduated from the University of Tokyo.

このカンマは非制限用法といわれる方法。
普通の形容詞は、制限を行う

- girls
- cute girls

Susan という固有名詞は一人しかいないから、非制限用法を使う。

1. Ken has a son who graduated from the University of Tokyo.
2. Ken has a son, who graduated from the University of Tokyo.

1 は複数いる子供のうち東大卒に制限している。
2 は子供は一人しかいないイメージになる。

とはいえ、そこまで細かく文意を読み取らなくても差し支えない。

I'm from Tokyo, which a lot of people visit.
I'm from Tokyo, where a lot of foreiners come.

graduate from Tokyo University は「東京大学を卒業する」という意味。
もともとは「学位を受け取る」という意味だから from を使うらしい。
graduate school で大学院をさしたりもする。

grade は（ラテン語では歩くみたいな意味）
grades = 成績。
gradually = 徐々に。（一歩ずつ）
degree = 学位。段階。
to some degree = ある程度。
to some extent = ある程度。

** 第52講 関係代名詞8

# ケンはスーザンに会えた。そのことが彼を幸せにした。
Ken finally saw Susan, which made him happy.

文を先行詞にとる非制限用法。
非制限用法では、that を使えないので注意。

# ケンはスーザンをみたと言った。それは全くの嘘だった。
John said he saw Susan, which was a complete lie.

# 最近、一緒に育ってきた人が連絡してきた。
A person with whom I grew up contacted me recently.
--------                     --------- --
  S                             V      O

who は主格なので with の後ろには whom になる。
元の文を考えてみよう。

A person (who) I grew up with contacted me recently.
I grew up with a person. he contacted me recently.

ハイレベル問題

I talked to the protesters, all of whom were students.
                            -----------
                                S

これは覚えるしかない。

** 第53講 関係代名詞9(連鎖関係代名詞)

The man who I thought was a manager was actually the president.

これは I thought をどかして考えてみよう

The man who was a manager was actually the president.
------- --- --- --------- --- ----------------------
  S      S'  V'    C'      V          C

ということで主格の関係代名詞が入っていることがわかる。
そしてこのケースでは、主格なのに省略できてしまう。
後ろに S V があって区切りが明確なので省略できる。

# 受講するのに一番良いクラスだよとKenが言っていたクラスは満員だった
The class which Ken said was the best to take was already full

こんなふうに間に S V が入っているときは連鎖関係代名詞という。
already のさまざまな使い方。
already = all ready = 全部できている

Do it already!  はやくやれ！
Enough already! もういい！
I've already done it.
I'm already doing it.
Are you leaving already?
Yes, it's already 11. もう11時だから

** 第54講 関係代名詞10(複合関係代名詞)

# 早くきた人は誰でもギフトをもらえます
Whoever comes early can receive a free gift.

先行詞がない関係代名詞。whoever は先行詞を飲み込んで「複合関係代名詞」を作れるようになる。

# 誰がリーダーになっても、サポートします
Whoever becomes our leader, I'll support her.

# Ken がどれを買っても、きっと喜ぶよ
Whichever ken buys, Susan will probably be happy.
Whatever ken buys, Susan will probably be happy.

# 好きなものを選びなさい
Choose witchever you like.

これは目的語が消えているのは、 whichever が複合関係代名詞だから。
whichever の選択肢を減らしたい時は名詞を置くことができる。

# なんでも好きな本を選びなさい
Choose whichever book you like.
Choose whatever book you like.

- この文章は choose, like の二つの動詞があるから関係代名詞を含んでいる。
- 命令文の動詞(Choose) + 目的語は従属節(whatever book you like) という構成。
- 従属節は主語(you) + 動詞(like) + 目的語(whatever book) という構成。
- whatever book が関係代名詞で、特に -ever で終わるものは複合関係代名詞と呼ばれる。
- 複合関係代名詞は、先行詞を持たない。「なんでも」という意味を加える特徴がある。
- ここで whatever book の book は文法的になんやねんという話もあるけど無視していい。
- たとえば I like this book という時に this book はひと塊の名詞として考えるのと同じ。

what や which は後ろに名詞を置くことがあるのと一緒。

what do you like?
which color do you like?
what food do you like?
what sports do you like?

Do you like this color? <- これの this と同じようなもの。

I don't know what color Susan likes.

John painted the wall in indigo, which color is close to violet.

** 第55講 関係代名詞11(複合関係副詞)

Wherever Susan goes, john follows her.
whenever Susan is happy, John is happy.

これらは「複合関係副詞」というもの。接続詞のように覚えてもOK。
従属節の塊の中で副詞、そして従属節自体を副詞にする。

# タスクがどれだけ難しくても、ジョンは諦めない
However difficult The task is, John won't give up.

however 形容詞 / however 副詞という用法。
語順が however に引っ張られて語順が入れ替わる。
セミコロンを使えば however を接続副詞として使うこともできる。

# タスクが難しい、しかしジョンは諦めない
The task is difficult; however, john won't give up.

# どんなに彼が試みても、John は Susan を幸せにできない
However hard he tries, John cannot make Susan happy.

** 第56講 助動詞1

# turned the game around with a two-run double = 2走者で2打点とって試合を逆転した？ → 2ラン2塁打

** 文法
*** section5 不定詞・動名詞
準動詞とは、動詞の形を変えることによって、動詞以外の品詞として働くもののこと。
**** 不定詞とは

不定詞とは、動詞を to 動詞の原型の形に変えたもののこと。
名詞、形容詞、副詞として働くことができる。

**** 不定詞（名詞的用法）
***** 形式主語

To master a foreign language is difficult for us.

上記の例では主語があるべき位置に to master a foreign language がある。
主語の to master が不定詞であり「マスターすること」という名詞として働いている。
さらに目的語 a foreign language もくっついて「外国語をマスターすること」という名詞句を作っている。
不定詞を主語に取るときは主語を it に置き換え、to ... は文末に持ってくることが多い。下記のようになる。

It is difficult for us to master a foreign language

この it は仮主語、形式主語と呼ばれる。

ところで for us は「外国語をマスターすること」が誰にとって難しいのかを指している。
そのため、文法上の主語は to master a foreign language だが、その主体は「私たち」と解釈できる。
これを区別するために for us で指示した us を「意味上の主語」と呼ぶらしい。

***** 形式目的語

Her help made it possible for us to finish the work.

これは S + V + O + C の第五文型の文章。
目的語があるべき位置に it を仮置きして、文末に真の目的語を置いている。
形式主語と違って、it なしで目的語を配置することはできない点に注意。

**** 不定詞（形容詞的用法）

I need something cold to drink.

これは S + V + O の第三文型の文章。
to drink は something cold を修飾して「冷たい飲み物」と訳す。
普通の文章と品詞の語順が逆になっていることに注意。

- 普通は 形容詞→名詞
- 不定詞は 名詞←形容詞

something to 動詞原型は会話表現でよく見られる。

I was the first person to arrive here

これは S + V + C の第二文型。
to arrive が the first person を修飾して「最初に到着した人」と訳す。

I have the plan to go to USA.

これも同じように考えることができる。

**** 不定詞（副詞的用法）

Jack came to Japan to study Japanese.

これは S + V の文章。to study Japanese は行為の目的を表している。

**** 原型不定詞

これまでの例からすると限定的なケース

The manager made us work overtime.

この文章は S V O O の文章なんだけれども、最後の O には work overtime は「残業する」という動詞が置かれている。
不定詞なのになぜか to がつかないという決まりになっているようだ。
原型不定詞をとる動詞は決まっている。下に代表例を書く。

- 知覚動詞 see, hear, feel
- 使役動詞 make, let, have, help

I see him enter the room

は原型不定詞を使った例。これは受動態で書き直すことができて下のようになる。

He was seen to enter the room.

受動態では to を省略できない。

**** 動名詞

My hobby is walking in the mountains.

動詞の進行形にして名詞の働きをする。使える場所が決まっている。
たとえば enjoy は to 不定詞を目的語にとることができず、動名詞だけを目的語に取る。

I enjoy talking with you. # GOOD
I enjoy to talk with you. # BAD

- 不定詞だけとるもの ... plan, promise, wish 未来に関わる動詞
- 動名詞だけとるもの ... enjoy, finish, mind 今に関わる動詞
- 両方取るもの       ... remember

とくに remember は意味が変わってくる。

I remember to take the trash out after dinner. # 夕食後にゴミを捨てるのを覚えておく
I remember taking the trash out.  # ゴミを捨てたのを覚えている

不定詞には未来の意味合いがあるというのがポイント。
**** 余談

I was grad to see you again.

これは S V C to ... という形。これは不定詞の副詞的用法。
to ... の形容詞的用法はあまり使われない。
ただ使われるのは I want something to drink みたいなの。
enjoy, stop, finish, give up, mind とかが動名詞をとる。

stop ...ing # ... を辞めた
stop to ... # ... するために立ち止まった

動名詞は実は、主語とかにも使えるので注意。

*** section6 分詞
さらに準動詞を学ぶ

**** 現在分詞・過去分詞

Look at the people sitting on the grass.

動詞の進行形に変えて形容詞の働きをさせるのが「分詞」
現在分詞は「今〜している」という意味合いを持たせる。
過去分詞は「〜した」という意味合いを持たせる。

running man のように1個の単語で修飾する時は形容詞→名詞
man running on the road のように2個以上の単語で修飾するときは名詞←形容詞

「〜させる」という動詞の分詞を使う時は過去分詞を受動態のようなニュアンスで使うことができる。
たとえば excite は「興奮させる」という意味だが excited spectators というと「興奮した観客」という意味になる。

Excited spectators rushed to the gate.

exciting spectators とは言わない。it is very exciting game のように言うことはできる。

**** 分詞構文

分詞構文はいきなり分詞から初めて副詞として働くもののこと。

Knowing the story, he could not enjoy the movie.

これは楽しむことができなかった理由を表す副詞句となっている。
分詞構文は恐ろしいことに下記のような意味がある。

- 理由
- 時
- 付帯状況
- 譲歩
- 結果

ただ、なんとなくくっついているだけで意味は推測するようになっているとのこと。
分詞構文は、文としては不完全で主語が落ちている。
なので、分詞構文では主語が一致していなければならない。

分詞構文は微妙に時間をずらすことができる。
主文よりももっと過去の話をしたいときには having + 過去分詞を使った分詞構文が使える。

Having eaten lunch, he went out to buy some ice cream.

上の例は、主文では「彼はアイスクリームを買いに行った」という過去のことを言っている。
分詞構文は、これよりも前のことを話しているので「昼食を食べたあと」と訳することになる。

**** 受動分詞構文

When it is seen from here, the mountain looks like a human face.

上の受動態の文章を素直に分詞構文にすると下のようになる。

Being seen from here, the mountain looks like a human face.

しかし分詞構文ではどういうわけか受動態の be 動詞が落ちて下のように書かれる。

Seen from here, the mountain looks like a human face.

これには理屈はない。なんとなく読めてしまうからそうなっているのかもしれない。

Because it was damaged by the storm, the bridge is not usable.

こんな感じで、主文と従属文で時間がずれている場合にも受動分詞構文を使うことはできる。

Damaged by the storm, the bridge is not usable.

この場合、受動態が使われているせいで主文と副詞句の時制がわからなくなっている。
それでも気にせず使ってしまうらしい。それでも主語が一致しないといけないというのがポイント。

**** 余談

分詞構文は日常的には使わない。
ニュースの見出しとかには使われる。

*** section7 関係詞
先に言ったことを補足する手法。
英語は後置修飾が多い。

**** 関係代名詞（主格）

the man who lives next door is my uncle
Did you attend the meeting which was held yesterday?

- the man, the metting は「先行詞」
- who は「関係代名詞」

先行詞自身の振る舞いを説明するのが主格
後ろに付随した文は主語が関係代名詞の完全な文となっている
主格は省略不可能。

**** 関係代名詞（所有格）

Did you meet the man whose son got the prize?
The house whose roof you can see over there is owned by Bill.

先行詞の持っているものに対して説明するのが所有格
関係代名詞は主語にならないことがあり、目的語が消失することもある

You can see the roof of the house over there. it is owned by Bill. って感じかな

**** 関係代名詞（目的格）

That is the man Meg loves very much.
Did you bring the pictures you took yesterday?

先行詞を目的語とするような文が後ろに付随するのが目的格
先行詞が目的語になっているため、後ろに付随した文から目的語が消えている
that や whom, which をいれてもいいけど基本的に省略される。

**** 関係副詞

This is the spot where he had the accident yesterday.
Do you know the reason why she was absent?

where, when, why が関係副詞
先行詞の説明をする
後ろに付随した文は完全な文となっている

これらは省略してより短くすることができる

This is where he had the accident yesterday.
Do you know why she was absent?

目的語をとるような場合は関係副詞が使えない。

**** 前置詞 + 関係代名詞

This is the house where he lived in his youth.
This is the house which he lived in in his youth.
This is the house in which he lived in his youth.

関係副詞は関係代名詞を言い換えることができる

**** 関係詞の非制限用法

I went to Seoul, where I first met her.
She laughed at me, which offended me a lot.

特定の語にかかる関係詞ではなくて、文全体にかかる関係詞にしたいときは、カンマを打つ。

**** 関係代名詞の what

先行詞かつ関係代名詞として振る舞う。

That's what happened yesterday.
What he did is wrong.

便利な使い方ができる。日本語で「〜することは」みたいな表現をしやすい。

*** section8 仮定法
本当はかなりの情報量があるはずだがシンプルにまとめてる。
could, would が丁寧語になるのは、あれが仮定法だから。
Would you open the door? みたいなの。
I would like to eat the ice cream. とかもそう。

**** 仮定法の基本

If I had a lot of money, I could buy a new house
If I were you, I would not say so.

If I had missed the last train, I could not have come home.

時制が過去または過去完了になっていることに注意。
そして後半の文章は助動詞 would, cloud, might を使う。

**** I wish と as if

あまり出てこないので知っておく程度でOK。

I wish I were a bird.
He talks as if he had discovered it for himself.

これらは過去形を使う基本表現からそれるけど仮定表現に使える文章。

I wish ... はあり得ないことを願う表現。
as if  ... 現実に反することをまるで現実のように言う表現。
